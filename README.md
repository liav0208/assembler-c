# Assembler to Machine Code Converter

## Description

Assembler project written in C language

This project is an assembler built with the C programming language, designed to convert assembly code into machine code (binary). It employs C for the implementation and leverages data structures like linked lists and stacks to efficiently parse and translate assembly instructions.

## Features

- **Assembly to Machine Code Conversion:** The core functionality of this project is to convert human-readable assembly code into binary machine code, making it suitable for execution on a specific computer architecture.

- **C Language Implementation:** The assembler is written in C, a versatile and efficient programming language known for its portability and low-level capabilities. This choice ensures that the assembler can be easily adapted for various platforms.

- **Data Structures:** The project utilizes data structures like linked lists and stacks to manage and process assembly code efficiently. Linked lists may be used for managing symbol tables or parsing code structures, while stacks are often employed to handle subroutine calls and track program flow.

## Getting Started

To use this assembler, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/liav0208/assembler-c.git`

2. Build the project: `make`

3. Run the assembler with your assembly code file as input: `./assembler input.as`

4. The assembler will generate a binary machine code file as output.

## Usage

```bash
$ ./assembler input.as
Output: input.ext input.ent input.am
```
