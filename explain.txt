Assembler Project:
This folder contain the source code for the assembler for "MAMAN 14, 2023 b"
In order to test this assembler i created some test files:

Errors:
e1.as e1-output.txt -> The e1.as file is the assembly file that contain some errors and the e1-output.png is the output from the terminal 
e2.as e2-output.txt -> The e2.as file is the assembly file that contain some errors and the e2-output.png is the output from the terminal 
e3.as e3-output.txt -> The e3.as file is the assembly file that contain some errors and the e3-output.png is the output from the terminal 

Succes:
t1.as t2.as t3.as -> those are example for files that compiled successfully without any issue or error, each of the file will get .am and .ob file with the same name.
if needed there will also be .ent and .ext files

Warn:
w1.as w2.as -> those files are files that contain some "Warning" but still manage to compiled, those files will create .am .ob .ent & .ext files but also will create 
[name]-output.png files with the terminal output as well.
